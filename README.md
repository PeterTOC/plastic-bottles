# Public Pollutants Project ðŸš¯

The data was collected by [Wastebase's Data Partners](https://www.unwaste.io/partners) by methods decribed on this [source page](https://www.kaggle.com/wastebase/plastic-bottle-waste)

### Context
Regularly-collected data about single-use plastic bottle waste found in public spaces, identified to the level of individual commercial products.

**Sample insights dataviz from the project**

As the dataset includes data scanned from several countries including;
- Mozambique
- Tanzania 
- Zambia
- Kenya
- Malawi
- Rwanda

It might be useful to aggregate the data by the country the plastic bottles were scanned from.

*Dashboard coming soon ...* ðŸ¤ž 

long term goals;

- To build a regression model to predict the number of bottles scanned for the coming months
- tune the gauge the model monthly and improve performance

                                       âœ¨ progress over perfection âœ¨
